Lyrics plugin for Powercord, supports searching and the pc-spotify plugin!

Currently contains a ``lyrics`` command which works like this: (replace ``/`` with your Powercord prefix)
* ``/lyrics`` - Returns lyrics of currently playing song on Spotify.
* ``/lyrics imagine dragons warriors`` - Searches for lyrics of args and returns them in chat.

The lyrics will be sent as a message in your current channel. If the message is too large it will send it to you as Clyde instead.

Output looks like this:
```
Imagine Dragons - Warriors


As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream


Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust


The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love


Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust




Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust
