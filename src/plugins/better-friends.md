Powercord plugin that aims to improve Discord's friend feature

# This plugin is a WIP
Although fairly stable and despite the fact that *most* modules are functional, some features may not be working as intended, or will change in the future.
If you have found a bug, feel free to report it on the issues tab.

### So, what does this do?
Glad you asked. Essentially, this plugin allows you to *favorite* friends. 
How are favorited friends different to normal friends you ask? Here is the current list of features (with more to come in the future):

* [See status changes live in the bottom right hand corner](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/ZDW25DI9.gif)
* [Adds a little star emoji next to their name](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/QhzivMAb.png)
* [Entirely new section in the DMs area that will prioritize DMs from favorited friends](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/f11PuwZH.png)
* [See when and where your favorite friends were last active](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/DOZPdrTn.mp4)
* [Integration with `pc-spotify` to listen along with your friends if they're listening to Spotify](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/tCO7Kn55.mp4)
* [Special "Favorited" tab inside of the "Friends" section to see all of your favorited friends at once](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/Lp76IzAp.png)
* Special notification sounds for favorited friends

... More features are planned, and will be coming in the future, such as:

* Big customization settings to allow you to change the names of any of your favorited friends
