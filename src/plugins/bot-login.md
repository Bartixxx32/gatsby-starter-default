Allow you to log in as a bot user instead of being automatically logged out.

### Only use this plugin while using a bot token!!!
If you have this enabled with a user account, you will get a plethora of errors.

#### To use this plugin:
1. Start Discord without the plugin enabled.
2. Open dev tools (Ctrl+Shift+I), go to the Application tab, and add or edit the `token` entry with the bot token in quotes, i.e. `"McgxZTUyMFh4BZB5NGzUIw.DPOp5Q.eeK-M6FyC6HKK8qTyjxJn7LNc1Ds"`.
3. Enable the plugin or add it to your `plugins` folder.
4. Close out Discord completely (right-click taskbar icon > Exit Discord), then relaunch it.
5. Have fun! :)
