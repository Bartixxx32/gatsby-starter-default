Adds the feature to create folders to organize your servers.

    - Right click a server > 'Serverfolders' > 'Create Folder' to create a folder.
    - To add servers to a folder hold 'Ctrl' and drag the server onto the folder, this will add the server to the folderlist and hide it in the serverlist.
    - To open a folder click the folder. A folder can only be opened when it has at least one server in it.
    - To remove a server from a folder, open the folder and either right click the server > 'Serverfolders' > 'Remove Server from Folder' or hold 'Del' and click the server in the folderlist.
    - Right clicking a folder gives you the option to
        - Clear all notifications of the servers within the folder (greyed out if no notifications are present).
        - Open the settingspopout for the folder to change the icon, the name and/or the color of the folder.
        - Delete the folder.
