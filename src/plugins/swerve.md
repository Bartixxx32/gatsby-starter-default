Plugin for Powercord that allows you to censor specific words anywhere in Discord

## What is this?
Not a fan of swear words? Maybe there's just a specific word that you never, *ever* want to see again on Discord. Kiss those concerns bye-bye with **Swerve**.
Swerve will quite literally blur any words you have specified in the settings (by default, it's just a number of everyday swear words)

It even works on channel names, usernames and other areas of the Discord app!
