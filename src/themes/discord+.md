**Discord+** is a theme that is both sleek and customizable, without getting in your way. Its top priority is balancing between looks and performance.

## User customization
This theme is **fully customizable**.
The variables at the top of the file allow you to change things like the background image, the accent color, and the roundness of the UI. You can also change the fonts to any fonts installed on your device.

## Complete theme
Discord+ aims to style everything on Discord. If thereâ€™s anything that is not styled, be it an official feature, a plugin, or a third-party feature, open an issue along with some information and I'll see what I can do.
